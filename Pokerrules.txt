As is the case with many other card games, Texas Hold'em is a game based off 
of bets. At the beginning of every turn, each player is given 2 cards, and 
based on the strength of the cards, each player wagers money in the pot, 
if they believe they have the best hand (or if they think they can force every 
other player to fold). After every hand, one card in the five card river is 
revealed, and further bets are taken. When all of the cards in the river are 
revealed, the remaining players will have their hand's compared, and the 
player with the highest hand will receive the whole pot. Hands are organized  
as follows: 

-Straight Flush (Five cards with consecutive values and the same suit) 
-Four of a Kind (Four cards with the same value) 
-Full House (A three of a kind of one card, and a pair of another card) 
-Flush (Five cards that share the same suit, but are not consecutive) 
-Straight (Five cards that have consecutive values, but are not the same suit) 
-Three of a Kind  (Three cards that share the same value) 
-Two Pair (Two instances of a pair in a single hand) 
-One Pair (Two cards that share the same value)      
-High Card (When none of the above apply, the card with the highest value is  
compared) 

That's it! Now go on and play some poker! 

P.S. If you go bankrupt that's it. Sorry!
