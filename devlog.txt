1-11-16     Shamaul       Created devlog.txt to keep track of actions.

1-11-16     Shamaul/Niels Created Card.java, and worked on adding the qualities
	    		  that each playing card has, such as its numerical 
			  value and its suit. We also started working on 
			  displaying cards with its atributes to the user.

1-11-16     Shamaul       Made cardOutline for each card work, which Niels 
	    		  started, and began to work on creating personalized
			  cards for each playing card. Also finished 
			  Card.java, which now will create a card given a 
			  value and a suit, and return a version of the card 
			  to the user, in card format.

1-12-16     Shamaul	  Finished commenting Card.java in order to maximize 
	    		  understanding by an outside viewer.

1-12-16     Shamaul/Niels Cleared out mechanism for determining the best hand
	    		  in a round on paper.

1-12-16     Shamaul       Created Deck.java that represents a completed card
	    		  deck, with shuffle functionality. Also fixed bug 
			  that occured when Card values were 10 when 
			  displaying the card.
 
1-13-16     Shamaul       Thought/wrote down ideas for the structure of 
	    		  Table.java as well as User.java. Also tested (not 
			  successfully) new ways to display each card.	 

1-14-16	    Niels 	  Expanded card classes from just an aesthetic additive
			  to a usable class to store card values.

1-15-16	    Niels 	  Added isStraight, isFlush,  isFourOfAKind, and helper function
